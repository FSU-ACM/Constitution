# ACM at FSU Chapter Consitution

We keep the source of our constitution on Github so changes may be easily proposed and tracked.

## Publication

We recommend using the pandoc utility to convert the markdown into .PDF form.

```bash
pandoc --toc --toc-depth=2 -o constitution.pdf florida-state-acm-constitution-2017.md
```
